1. What did we do ? =
We got a brief overview to the concept of computational thinking and it's factors. Afterwards we tried to apply it in a practical sense by 
creating an algorithm to create a jam sandwich. We tried to be as specific and precise with our instructions and then we got feedback to 
improve our algorithms.
1. What did you learn? = I learned how precision and short instructions can be highly efficient. It is only a matter of clarity and how we present the instructions. 
Me and my partner in the assignment ended up putting a lot of effort to being very clear but not concise and that is why we came up short. 
1. What question do I have? =
My major question is whether computational thinking requires a lot of experience to be good with or whether you can utilize computational 
thinking on the first go and still get good results.
