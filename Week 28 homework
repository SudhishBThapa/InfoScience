# What are some ways in which Computer Science can help the fight against Covid-19?
#In your opinion, should people enable access to the resources of their personal computers as tools for research? Are there any risks?

= The behavior of Covid-19 needs to be properly observed in order to find a way to combat the virus itself. Trying to find vulnerabilities of 
the virus will then lead us to a cure. However, the issue currently is that techniques such as X-ray crystallography and cryo-electron microscopy
have not allowed us to observe the virus' behavior. So 3D simulations are the next option to observe the virus. This is where computer science and
computing itself is important to fight against Covid-19. In my opinion people should enable access to their PCs as tools for research because of the situation we are in. At this point, I feel like any measures should be taken given how desperate the situation of fighting
the virus is getting. The only risk that I see happening is the people's opinions in terms of whether they want to give up their computers for research purposes.
